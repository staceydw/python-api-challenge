Module 6 API Challenge

Summary of Findings:
Both the WeatherPy and VacationPy reveal a relationship between the latitue and longitude and the weather that can be expected. Though not exact, as can be seen in the scatter plot, the data can be helpful in determining how latitude and longitude relate to (and impact) cloudiness, humidity, wind speed and other conditions that one must prepare for. Using the data from WeatherPy, we can look at the conditions in a given city to see what the weather might be if we are planning a vacation. As mentioned in the document, longitude has a big impact on weather conditions, as does the topography of a given place. For example, the mountains in Patagonia, Argentina will be more like the mountains in Alaska, high in the Northern Hemisphere, while conditions close to the equator will be warmer and more temperate throughout the year.

Help was received from Angel Milla, who is a bootcamp tutor. He helped with some errors that were occuring with the scatter plots. After he demonstrated on the first one, I was able to replicate the rest. 
Help was also received from ChatGPT when trying to figure out what went wrong with my API key.
